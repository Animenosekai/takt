## Purpose

`takt` is a simple, lightweight and privacy-focused music bot for your [Discord](http://discord.com) servers.

You are just a few seconds away from having your own private music discord bot !

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3 to use this module

```bash
Minimum required versions: 3.8
```

Although the code itself is made compatible with Python >=3.6, the dependencies require at least Python 3.8.

Always check if your Python version works with `takt` before using it in production.

## Installing

### Option 1: From PyPI

```bash
pip install --upgrade takt
```

> This will install the latest version from PyPI

### Option 2: From Git

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Animenosekai/takt.git
```

> This will install the latest development version from the git repository

You can check if you successfully installed it by printing out its version:

```bash
$ takt --version
1.0
```

### FFmpeg

You also need [`ffmpeg`](http://ffmpeg.org) installed on your computer to be able to run `takt` properly.

## Usage

### CLI

#### Running

Running takt is dead simple:

```bash
takt --token=<YOUR DISCORD TOKEN>
```

And this is even easier if you set the `TAKT_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
takt
```

> **Note**  
> You could also try hosting your bot on Heroku directly by using this repository since it already has a [`Procfile`](https://github.com/Animenosekai/takt/blob/main/Procfile)

#### Prefix

You can set the bot's command prefix using the `--prefix` argument:

```bash
takt --prefix=">"
```

#### More

For more information, head over to your terminal and enter:

```bash
takt --help
```

### Invite

Here is the current invite URL for the public version:

> <https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=923625007333113856&permissions=274881055744&scope=bot%20applications.commands>

You can create your own URL by replacing your Client ID:

```http
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&permissions=274881055744&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

This Client ID can be found on your Discord Developer Portal, after selecting your bot, under the *OAuth2* section.

> **Warning**  
> The live public version of the bot is almost always down and shouldn't be used for anything other than development

### Discord

Here is a list of commands you can use:

- `+play <search term>`: Searches on YouTube and plays the first result
- `+play <link>`: Play the given link
- `+playing`: Show the current song playing
- `+pause`: Pause the current song
- `+resume`: Resume the current song
- `+skip`: Skip the current song
- `+queue`: Show the current queue
- `+clear`: Clear the queue
- `+stop`: Stop the music and clear the queue
- `+loop`: Toggle looping

- `+latency`: Show the current latency
- `+connected`: Show if the bot is connected to a voice channel
- `+help`: Show this message
- `+help <command>`: Show specific command's help

> **Note**  
> The `+` prefix is the default one and can be changed as explained in [*Prefix*](#prefix)

Head to your discord server and check `+help` or `+help <command>` for further details on the different commands (aliases, examples, etc.)
